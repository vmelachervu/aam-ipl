# Applied AI & ML Industry Projects Lab (AAM-IPL) - Sem-V/VI CSE, CSM, CSD Undergrad Students (B.Tech), G.Pulla Reddy Engineering College, Kurnaool, AP, India

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Applied AI & ML Industry Projects Lab (AAM-IPL)**! This lab program is designed for undergraduate computer science engineering students to gain hands-on experience in coding, implementing, and understanding key artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms with real-world industry data.

---

## Objective

The AAM-IPL program aims to:
- Provide practical, project-based learning to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in AI and ML.
- Equip students with hands-on skills in implementing core ML techniques, including:
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Decision Tree Classification (DTC)**
  - **K-Means Clustering**
  - **Probabilistic Clustering**
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
  
Through this program, students will collaborate on projects that solve real-world industry challenges, preparing them for AI and ML roles in the industry.
