    "# Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n",
    "# Hint: Import libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn modules for models and metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Set Up Multiprocessing for CPU Cores (Optional)\n",
    "# Set LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT to CPU count to avoid warnings\n",
    "# Hint: Use `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` to get CPU core count, then set it with `os.environ`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Load and Preprocess the Wine Dataset\n",
    "# Load the Wine dataset and convert it to a DataFrame.\n",
    "# Hint: Use `load_wine()` from sklearn and convert to DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Split Dataset into Training and Test Sets\n",
    "# Split the data with a test size of 20%.\n",
    "# Hint: Use `train_test_split()` with `stratify=y` to maintain class balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Standardize Features\n",
    "# Standardize the dataset for better model performance.\n",
    "# Hint: Use `StandardScaler()` to fit and transform training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 6: Define Models\n",
    "# Define a dictionary containing all models to compare.\n",
    "# Include: Logistic Regression, LDA, GDA, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, K-Means Clustering.\n",
