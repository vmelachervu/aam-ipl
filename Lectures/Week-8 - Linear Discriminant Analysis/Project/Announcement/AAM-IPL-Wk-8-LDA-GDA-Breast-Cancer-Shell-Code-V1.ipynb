    "# Step 3: Split Dataset into Training and Test Sets\n",
    "# Split the data with a test size of 20%.\n",
    "# Hint: Use `train_test_split()` from sklearn with `stratify=y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Standardize Features\n",
    "# Standardize the dataset for optimal model performance.\n",

    "# Step 5: Define Models\n",
    "# Define a dictionary containing all the models you will use.\n",
